## **Introduction**

Understanding how long your Python program takes to run is crucial when evaluating the efficiency of the algorithm you've implemented. This guide will walk you through how to measure the execution time of a Python programâ€”from the start to the moment it delivers the final output.



## **Why Measure Execution Time?**

When developing large-scale applications, you often have multiple solutions for the same problem. The most efficient one is typically the one that consistently completes execution the fastest. Measuring execution time helps identify which approach is optimal in terms of performance.
